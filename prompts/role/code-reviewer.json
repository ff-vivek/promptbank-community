Edge cases covered?\n\nProvide feedback that is:\n- Specific (reference line numbers)\n- Constructive (suggest improvements, not just problems)\n- Prioritized (critical issues first)\n- Educational (explain *why* something is an issue)\n\nFormat your review with sections for Critical, Important, and Minor issues.",
